                <p class="thresholds-description">'Thresholds' brings together the work of nine artists who chart their individual spiritual, political, physical or mythological journeys of transformation. Forming a chorus of unique experiences, all of which are shaped by the crossing of a 'threshold', the works selected reflect an understanding of the coexistence of light and dark; a dynamic whereby opposite forces are not at odds but in balance.</p>
